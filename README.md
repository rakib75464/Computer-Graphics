Welcome to my **Computer Graphics Projects** repository!  
This repository contains all my **2D and 3D Computer Graphics experiments** using **C++ and OpenGL (GLUT)** in Code::Blocks.  

I explored multiple themes, animations, transformations, and interactive simulations. Each folder contains a project with source code and sometimes screenshots.

## About the Repository

During my learning journey, I worked on:

- **2D Graphics**: drawing shapes, transformations, and animations  
- **3D Graphics**: objects, rotations, scaling, camera views, lighting  
- Interactive programs and simulations  
- Applying OpenGL concepts step by step from beginner to advanced  

This repository reflects my **progression from basic 2D exercises to complex 3D projects**.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Graphics Library:** OpenGL (GLUT)  
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks  
- **OS:** Windows / Linux (GLUT compatible)

## 2D Graphics Examples

Some of the 2D projects:

- Drawing basic **shapes**: lines, rectangles, circles, polygons  
- **2D Transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling  
- **2D Animations**: bouncing balls, moving objects  
- Interactive pattern programs

## 3D Graphics Examples

Some of the 3D projects:

- **3D Objects**: cube, sphere, cone, pyramid, teapot  
- **3D Transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling in 3D space  
- **Lighting & Shading** experiments  
- **3D Animations**: spinning planets, solar system simulation  
- **Camera Views** and perspective

## How to Run

1. Install **Code::Blocks** with **OpenGL/GLUT** support  
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakib75464/Computer-Graphics.git
Open the project folder in Code::Blocks

Build and run the .cpp file you want

Explore all 2D and 3D examples

Ensure GLUT is installed and linked properly in Code::Blocks.
